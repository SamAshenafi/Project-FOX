## Idea
So here's some topics about for our text-based adventure game to get us started.
Feel free to add more, edit them, or answer them here or on Discord

### Questions
- Will it be CLI or GUI?
    - CLI means the user/player can only interact using text
        - pros: simple, easy
        - cons: limiting, no art, hard/unintuitive to interact
        - i (chris) can do some basic GUI (buttons & basic info display)
        w/ React & Tauri if we decided to do CLI
    - GUI means
        - pros: more mechanics/interactions, more intuitive UI, art, maybe even sound
        - cons: difficult
        - i can do the art for the project if we can use sprite
- What is the general Theme/Story? (we can change this later on)

### General Mechanics
- Dialog (back & forth between the player & the game)
- Dialog Choice (player should have multiple options to reply back)

### Optional Mechanics
which one should we do? how will it be implemented?
- Navigation
    - move to new area -> something happen
- Quest System
- NPC System (player can actively choose to interact w/ NPC)
- Combat System
    - Enemy
    - Combat Statistics
        - HP
        - Attack Damage (AD)
        - Armor (Flat & %DMG Negation)
        - ...
    - Player Inventory
        - Equipment
        - Level/EXP?
        - Consumable/Items?
        - Undertale act/spare mechanic?
